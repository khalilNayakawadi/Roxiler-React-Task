# Roxiler Systems Assignment

## **Backend (Node.js and SQLite):**

1. **Initialize the Project:**
    - Create a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
    - Install necessary dependencies like Express.js, SQLite3, and any other required packages.
2. **Database Setup:**
    - Create a SQLite database file to store task-related data. You can use a library like `sqlite3` to interact with the database.
    - Define a schema for your database tables (e.g., `Tasks` table with columns like `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, etc.).
    - To create a new database file in the node app, **create a file** **with** `.db` **extension**.
    - **Create a table** and insert the details in the table with the help of `sqlite cli`
    - Refer to the session **[Introduction to Express JS | Part 2](https://learning.ccbp.in/backend-development/course?c_id=f44d3635-58da-4c85-a9bf-29857c7c989b&s_id=bc846adc-3c12-4db3-8393-561f9fcfaa7d&t_id=f670e7f3-afa6-45c5-83cb-140433a8aa77)** in the topic **Introduction to Express JS** to know how to **access the database** using the CLI.
    - Refer to the session **[Introduction To SQL | Part - 1](https://learning.ccbp.in/backend-development/course?c_id=5d03f5a4-a285-4e52-8a57-18f718c4859f&s_id=44d357c8-d158-41f3-8bad-e0e269a9b904&t_id=5b2c32ee-9e6e-49ba-bcda-339076b98b69)** in the topic **Introduction To SQL** of **Introduction to Databases** course to know how to **create** **a** **table**.
3. **Get Data from the given API URL:**
    - Fetch data from an external API using the `axios`. Axios is an HTTP library for Promise-based asynchronous requests.
    - The fetched data should then iterates through the data, and for each item, check if it already exists in the database. If an item **doesn't exist,** it should be inserted into the database.
    
    **Sample Code:**
    
    ```jsx
    const axios = require("axios"); /*Importing the axios library*/
    
    const fetchAndInsert = async () => {
      const response = await axios.get(
        "https://s3.amazonaws.com/roxiler.com/product_transaction.json"
      );
      const data = response.data;
    
      for (let item of data) {
        const queryData = `SELECT id FROM transactions WHERE id = ${item.id}`;
        const existingData = await db.get(queryData);
        if (existingData === undefined) {
          const query = `
       INSERT INTO transactions (id, title, price, description, category, image, sold, dateOfSale) 
       VALUES (
           ${item.id},
           '${item.title.replace(/'/g, "''")}',
           ${item.price},
           '${item.description.replace(/'/g, "''")}',
           '${item.category.replace(/'/g, "''")}',
           '${item.image.replace(/'/g, "''")}',
           ${item.sold},
           '${item.dateOfSale.replace(/'/g, "''")}'
       );
    `; /*The .replace(/'/g, "''") in the SQL query helps prevent SQL injection attacks by escaping single quotes.*/
    
          await db.run(query);
        }
      }
      console.log("Transactions added");
    };
    
    fetchAndInsert();
    ```
    
4. **API Endpoints:**
    - Implement endpoints for tasks such as `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/:id`, `DELETE /tasks/:id`.
    - These endpoints should interact with the SQLite database to perform the corresponding operations.
5. **Error Handling and Validation:**
    - Implement error handling for invalid requests or database errors.
    - Validate input data to ensure it meets your application's requirements.
6. **Testing:**
    - Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
    - Ensure that CRUD operations work correctly and return appropriate responses.

## **Frontend (React.js):**

1. **Initialize the React App:**
    - Create a new React.js application using `create-react-app`.
2. **Component Structure:**
    - Design your component structure. For a task management app, you might have components like TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm, etc.
3. **Fetch Data:**
    - Use React's built-in `fetch`to fetch data from the Node.js backend.
    - Display the list of tasks on the frontend.
4. **Create and Update Tasks:**
    - Implement forms for creating and updating tasks.
    - Use controlled components to manage form input state.
    - Send POST and PUT requests to the backend to create and update tasks.
5. **Delete Tasks:**
    - Implement a feature to delete tasks by sending a DELETE request to the backend.
6. **Error Handling and Validation:**
    - Display error messages to the user if there are issues with creating, updating, or deleting tasks.
7. **Styling and UI:**
    - Use CSS or a styling library like Bootstrap or Material-UI to style your frontend components.
8. **Testing:**
    - Test your React components by interacting with the application to ensure it works as expected.

**Integration:**

1. **Connect Frontend and Backend:**
    - Make API requests from your React components to the Node.js backend using the appropriate URL endpoints.
2. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your frontend React app and Node.js backend separately. You can use services like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel for the frontend and platforms like Heroku or AWS for the backend.
    - Refer to this [tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rNaqx-tYQrE5_7UxamvZ0atBa3nq4K8x/view) to know how to deploy your Node JS project using CCBP IDE and fetch your own data from the Data fetch URLs.
3. **Testing in Production:**
    - Test your deployed application to ensure that it works correctly in a production environment.
- You can use the React Recharts to display the graph.
- Refer to [this](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/BarChart) doc to know how to achieve the Bar graphs using Recharts.
